EXTERNAL SetSpeaker(character)

This is a test!
Here's another line!
//export function calls in ink to other functions
 /*
    1) function for switching characters (param = char name)
    2) function for story ends (trigger for story ending? ink maybe has that?)
    [no need for choices]
    
    prefab for dialog
 */
 How may I help you, my asphyxiated feline friend?
